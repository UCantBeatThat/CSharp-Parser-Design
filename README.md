In order to execute the program, the user only needs to run a bash script with the
required input file as command line arguement. For Ex: if sum_digits.cs is the file name,
then the command would be 

COMMAND: bash cSharpExec.sh sum_digits.cs

All the input files are to be stored in the Input/ folder.
