The objective of the project is to create a Lexical Analyzer that will determine tokens present in
the code of the chosen programming language that is given as input, followed by the construction
of a Symbol Table that will store the identifiers and their respective attribute values, and finally
implementing a bottom-up parser for the grammar that will parse a given input.

In order to execute the program, the user only needs to run a bash script with the
required input file as command line arguement. For Ex: if sum_digits.cs is the file name,
then the command would be 

COMMAND: bash cSharpExec.sh sum_digits.cs

All the input files are to be stored in the '/Input' folder.
